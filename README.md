# Typing-Speed-Test
App to test a user's typing speed.

Utilizes famous passages from classic literature as the test sentences. Will calculate words per minute, errors, and percent match to the original text. Runs from command line or interpreter.

Future versions will have saved user data, a leaderboard, and percent match requirements to be a valid testing of speed.
